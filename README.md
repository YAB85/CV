I build iOS apps and write Swift libraries. I love OSS and try to put all my stuff on GitHub, where you are most likely reading this. 

I spend a lot of time learning new skills. Currently, I'm invested into *Functional Programming*, *Image processing*, *Unit Testing* and *Application Architecture*.

**I'm open to job opportunities**. If you are a recruiter or hiring manager or just want to refer me to your company - feel free to reach out!
